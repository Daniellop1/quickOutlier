Description: Implements a suite of tools for outlier detection and treatment 
    in data mining. It includes univariate methods (Z-score, Interquartile Range), 
    multivariate detection using Mahalanobis distance, and density-based 
    detection (Local Outlier Factor) via the 'dbscan' package. It also 
    provides functions for visualization using 'ggplot2' and data cleaning 
    via Winsorization.
