\title{Diagnose Influential Points in Linear Models (Cook's Distance)}
\usage{
diagnose_influence(data, target, predictor, cutoff = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{target}{Character. The name of the dependent variable (Y).}

\item{predictor}{Character. The name of the independent variable (X).}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric (Optional). A custom threshold for Cook's Distance.
If NULL, it defaults to 4/n.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original data plus:
\item{Cooks_Dist}{The calculated Cook's distance for each point.}
\item{Is_Influential}{Logical flag. TRUE if Cooks_Dist > cutoff.}
}
\description{
Fits a linear model between two variables and calculates Cook's Distance to identify
influential points. An influential point is an outlier that specifically affects
the slope of the regression line.
}
\details{
Cook's distance (\eqn{D_i}) measures the effect of deleting a given observation.
Points with a large \eqn{D_i} are considered to have high leverage and influence.

The default threshold for detection is calculated as:
\deqn{Threshold = \frac{4}{n}}
Where \eqn{n} is the number of observations. This is a standard rule of thumb
in regression diagnostics.
}
\examples{
# Example: A point that pulls the regression line
df <- mtcars
# Artificially create a leverage point
df[1, "wt"] <- 10
df[1, "mpg"] <- 50
result <- diagnose_influence(df, "mpg", "wt")
head(result)
}
